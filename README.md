# BMUX

bmux is a simple tmux session manager for my personal use. It is written in bash
with integration of fzf and it is **much much** faster than tmuxinator/tmuxp. The
benefit of running custom start up script for tmux instead of a yaml file and get it processed
through tmuxinator/tmuxp is faster, ZERO errors, flexible and just as easy and intuitive
using a yaml file.

- Magenta: running managed session
- Light gray: stopped managed session
- Yellow: running unmanaged session
